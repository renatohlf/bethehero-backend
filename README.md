## Getting Started

Start by installing the dependencies 

```bash 
    yarn install
```

Start Mongodb with Replica Sets

```bash 
    yarn rs
```

In another terminal, run the application using nodemon

```bash 
    yarn dev
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the production mode<br>

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

Currently the app is built on Heroku after every push to master branch.

## Troubleshooting

### `yarn dev` mongodb not running

`MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017` <br>

If you are getting an error message like this in your terminal, it means that you need to run mongodb with Replica Sets. <br>

Run mongodb Replica Sets using the command `yarn rs`, then restart your application running `yarn dev` ant it may work.
